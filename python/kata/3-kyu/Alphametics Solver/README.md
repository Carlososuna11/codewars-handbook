# [Codewars Alphametics Solver](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b5fe164b88263ad3d00250b)

### Details
[Alphametics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_arithmetic) is a type of cryptarithm in which a set of words is written down in the form of a long addition sum or some other mathematical problem. The objective is to replace the letters of the alphabet with decimal digits to make a valid arithmetic sum.

For this kata, your objective is to write a function that accepts an alphametic equation in the form of a single-line string and returns a valid arithmetic equation in the form of a single-line string.

### Test Examples
```
INPUT:    "SEND + MORE = MONEY"
SOLUTION: "9567 + 1085 = 10652"

INPUT:    "ELEVEN + NINE + FIVE + FIVE = THIRTY"
SOLUTION: "797275 + 5057 + 4027 + 4027 = 810386"
```

Some puzzles may have multiple valid solutions; your function only needs to return one

```
BIG + CAT = LION
403 + 679 = 1082
326 + 954 = 1280
304 + 758 = 1062
...etc.
```
### Technical Details
- All alphabetic letters in the input will be uppercase
- Each unique letter may only be assigned to one unique digit
As a corollary to the above, there will be a maximum of `10` unique letters in any given test
No leading zeroes
- The equations will only deal with addition with multiple summands on the left side and one term on the right side
- The number of summands will range between `2` and `7`, inclusive
- The length of each summand will range from `2` to `8` characters, inclusive
- All test cases will be valid and will have one or more possible solutions
- Full Test Suite: `15` fixed tests, `21` random tests for Python and Ruby / `18` random tests for JavaScript / 28 random tests for Go and C# / `136` random tests for Java / `72` random tests for Kotlin
- Optimize your code -- a naive, brute-force algorithm may time out before the first test completes
- For JavaScript, `module` and  `require` are disabled, and most prototypes are frozen (except Array and Function)
- For Python, module imports are prohibited
- `Python users`: Due to the performance of the Python runner, it is advised to attempt solving this kata in another language besides Python.
- Use Python 3.6+ for the Python translation

### NOTE:
This code can fix the problem, but it is not optimized to do many test cases in less than 12 seconds. for the test cases of the file `main.py` it takes a total of 23-24 sec
